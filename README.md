# Airline_Crud_App

Author: William Leonardo da Silva Carvalho

---
## Initial Ideias
To create a simple API that could be able to insert data to database (mongodb) and also to delete data, and deploy it on Heroku.

---
## Interactive Web Applications CA2
- API service created wtih Node.js, mongoDB and deployed on Heroku that supports full 
CRUD for your existing CA1 app

- Updated existing CA1 app populating the HTML table with JSON data 
provided by the API, implemented the ability to Add and Delete clients from that table.

- Deployed application to Heroku and database to MongoDB Atlas.

- Clean, intuitive and responsive user interface with Boostrap and appropriate visual
representation of the data on the client-side (CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks).

- Security measures, such as validation of user input on the client-side (JavaScript/JS
frameworks) and sanitisation of user input on the server-side (Node.js) through the use of
appropriate modules.

## Problems occurred/solutions

- 1 - nav bar was not responsive / I went to w3school and saw a few examples how to do it and solved it.
- 2 - when you select some text in the browsers it is highlighted normally in blue color. / disable this highlighting with the CSS
- 3 - when I was trying to deploy it in  EU area I could not get it deployed, I dont know why is that but I had to deploy it on US area.
